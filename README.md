# ATLAS interview analysis

This is a short analysis challenge that you will complete as a part of interviewing to join the LBL ATLAS group! You may use any internet resources, as you would while working on research. Particularly helpful will be StackOverflow, the ROOT project forums, and anything else on google.

## Challenges

### 1. Setting up ROOT

[ROOT](https://root.cern/) is a physics data analysis software based on C++. It can be installed in many ways, but the easiest is to use an anaconda environment. 

**For this part of the challenge, figure out how to install and run ROOT c++ in your terminal.** This should be easily doable for any computer with 

### 2. Opening physics data

Next, download and open the file hosted [here](https://atlas-opendata.web.cern.ch/atlas-opendata/samples/2020/1largeRjet1lep/MC/mc_361106.Zee.1largeRjet1lep.root) in ROOT. Extract the tree named "mini" from the file.

### 3. Plotting Lepton Count

Finally, make a histogram of the number of leptons in the tree. This variable will be called "lep_n". Screenshot your plotting code and plot, and bring it to the interview!
